keg is written in Python, it uses [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to setup a development environment
for the desired Python version. Make sure the Python development headers
are installed (e.g. `python36-devel`)

Currently, there are 5 targets for tox:

- **check**: for code quality and integrity
- **devel**: for development
- **doc**: for building man pages
- **unit_py3_8**: to run unit tests with Python version set to *3.8*
- **unit_py3_6**: to run unit tests with Python version set to *3.6*

The following procedure describes how to create the development environment:

1. Let tox create the virtual environment(s):

   .. code:: bash

       $ tox -e devel

2. Activate the virtual environment
    
   .. code:: bash

       $ source .tox/3/bin/activate

3. Install requirements inside the virtual environment:

   .. code:: bash

       $ pip install -U pip setuptools
       $ pip install -r .virtualenv.dev-requirements.txt

4. Let setuptools create/update your entrypoints

   .. code:: bash

       $ ./setup.py develop

Once the development environment is activated and initialized with
the project required Python modules, you are ready to work.

In order to leave the development mode just call:

.. code:: bash

   $ deactivate

To resume your work, change into your local Git repository and
run `source .tox/3/bin/activate` again. Skip step 3 and 4 as
the requirements are already installed.
